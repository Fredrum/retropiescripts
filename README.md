# retropiescripts

My scripts for setting up Raspberry Pi + Retropie with scripts Iv'e made myself to improve the experience.
Iv'e got Bluetooth connected DS4 controller, Apple Aipods plus another DIY built bt audio receiver. I can switch on the fly and change the out volume for the devices.

There's a udev rule file plus script to change the LED color of the DS4 on connection.
